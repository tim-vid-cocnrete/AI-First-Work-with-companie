## LinkedIn history with Contact C

- 2024-07-17T19:50:18 ⬅️: Contact C → Person B — Hey Person B! Reaching out from VC Fund G, a City H-based investment firm. I've sent you a couple of emails, but in short, I would love to set up a quick call to learn more about Company Zeta. Do you have time for a quick call this week or next?
- 2024-07-17T20:11:14 ➡️: Person B → Contact C — Hey Contact C,  Sure, let's chat.  Choose time here [ANONYMIZED_CALENDAR_LINK] or send me your link, pls.
- 2024-07-17T20:14:24 ⬅️: Contact C → Person B — Just booked 4:30pm ET on Wednesday next week. Looking forward to it!
- 2024-07-17T20:14:40 ➡️: Person B → Contact C — Great!
- 2025-08-07T23:34:54 ➡️: Person B → Contact C — Hey Contact C,  Last time we talked, i made a note to get back when we reach $TM in ARR. So here we are :-)  We've grown to $TM in ARR and are now launching a super AI agent for performance marketers.  Blurb: Company Zeta is pioneering "vibe marketing" with the world's first AI superagent for performance marketing, automating N% of campaign management and reporting for ad-driven businesses. The problem: in a world where channel competition keeps rising, survival depends on the ability to run and optimize hundreds of tests per week — impossible without deep automation. With Company Zeta, marketers simply tell what they want, and our AI agent executes across all channels. Our clients on average reduce CAC by N1%, increase Revenue by N2% and Gross Profit by N3%.  Key metrics: ARR: $TM (+N% in last 3 months) ACV: ~$UK per year SAM: $VB (Xk target US companies * $UK acv) Payback Period: N months NDR: >N%  We're raising $WM Seed+ to accelerate our AI agent rollout and scale to $RM ARR.  I'd love to get on a call with you. Does calendly work for you [ANONYMIZED_CALENDAR_LINK] ?
- 2025-08-15T22:27:07 ➡️: Person B → Contact C — New week, updated blurb:  Company Zeta is pioneering "vibe marketing" with the world's first AI superagent for performance marketing, automating up to N% of work.  While most tools are built for e‑commerce, we focus on the largest non‑e‑com categories: b2c software, subscriptions, and services. These businesses require cohort‑aware, lag‑adjusted decisioning, LTV forecasting, lead quality signals, and off‑site revenue tracking.  We combine a battle‑tested attribution/data backbone with an AI superagent. Outcome: −CAC, +Revenue, +Gross Profit — algorithms finally optimize for real business results.  Key metrics: ARR: $TM ACV: ~$UK per year SAM: $VB (Xk target US companies × $UK ACV) Payback Period: N months NDR >N%  Backed by: Fund P, Fund Q, Angel Investor F (Product I), Angel Investor G (Company J), Angel Investor H (Company K), Angel Investor I & Angel Investor J (Company L/Product M), Angel Investor K (Company K / Fund N), Angel Investor L (Company O)  Founders: Person B & Person E, Y years building businesses together, built a profitable X-employee digital agency, and two other companies
