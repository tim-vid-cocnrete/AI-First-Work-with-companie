Hello again Person B!

I shared the questions with Contact G and she feels that while it's a fantastic
topic, this might not be the best conversation for us to provide a strong
perspective. We'd love for you to keep Company QQQ in mind for future "evolution
of martech" topics though, and wish you all the best for a successful
event!

Thank you again for the opportunity.

Best,
Person H

Person H, that's just a starting point. Maybe Contact G could share a few topics
she'd feel comfortable discussing, and we'll make sure to ask her only one
or two questions within that range. That's actually what we've done with
the other speakers as well. We know the focus is a bit narrow, and we're
happy to keep it more general if that helps.

We'd really like to have her on the panel.

Happy to get on a call today. Let me know.

Ah - got it! In that case, let's have you and Contact G chat tomorrow at
11:00am PT. I've cc'd her here to work out the call details.

Thanks Person B!

Cheers,
Person H

Hi Person B and Person D,
following up on our chat - here is a question Person H suggested:

A fragmented brand with incomplete data will get lost in the agentic realm.
What should brands do now (or even next 12 months or something if you want
to make it even more time-bound and prescriptive) to build the foundational
data and connectivity required to be agent-ready?

Please let me know if that works?

thank you,
Contact G

**Subject**: Re: Invitation to Speak during US City B Tech Week | "Re-Imagining the Future of Agentic MarTech" | October 10th

Hi Contact G,

After conversations with you and other panel participants, here is an
updated list of questions:

--

1. **"Real wins - show me the magic"**
"Let's start with reality. Give me ONE concrete example - from your
customers OR from inside your own company - where AI is actually delivering
impact. Not 'testing,' not 'promising.' What's working TODAY that feels
like the future?"
- Opens with concrete proof, not theory
- Focus on things beyond content generation
- Flexibility: customer case OR internal usage
- "Feels like the future" = shows transformation, not just efficiency
- Sets tone: we want specific, impressive examples
- **Format:** Round-robin, each founder shares one story

2. **"What becomes unnecessary?"** [THE OTHER SIDE]
"I'm curious - let's look at the other side. AI brings efficiencies and
wins, but it also makes things obsolete, unnecessary. What are you or your
customers already considering scrapping? What are you looking at and
thinking 'oh, we can skip that'? Maybe it's part of a process, maybe it's a
person, maybe it's budget allocation. What becomes unnecessary?"
- Frames as curiosity, not judgment - invites honest sharing
- "Already considering" = real decisions being made now, not theoretical
- Covers processes, roles, AND budgets - multiple dimensions
- "The other side" = balances the positive with the reality of displacement
- Shows what actually changes when you adopt AI, not just gains

3. **"The AI-first paradigm shift"** [MINDSET, NOT TOOLS]
"We've seen paradigm shifts before - digital-first, mobile-first - each
time it fundamentally changed how companies work, not just incremental
improvements. AI-first feels like the next big shift. What does AI-first
actually MEAN to you? Not just 'we use AI tools' - what are you doing TODAY
in your company that wasn't possible or didn't make sense before? Give me
concrete examples of how AI-first changes how you build, operate, decide."
- About fundamental paradigm shift, not incremental efficiency gains
- Forces concrete examples: "Here's what we do differently TODAY"
- Not theoretical - what specific decisions/actions come from AI-first
mindset
- Shows the shift: "This never existed before, now it's how we work"
- Mindset over tools - how it changes thinking and operating, not just what
software you use
- Reveals what's fundamentally different, not just "a bit more efficient"

4. **"Your bet on the future"** [PERSONAL VISION]
"You're building a company around a specific vision of the future. You're
making bets - with your time, your team, your investors' money. What's YOUR
bet? What are you building right now, and WHY? Tell me: 'We're building
THIS because we believe it will work like THAT.' What's the specific thing
you're building and the future you see for it?"
- Forces concrete examples: "We're building THIS because..."
- Not just vision, but the WHAT and WHY of their product decisions
- Shows the reasoning behind their bets
- Personal conviction backed by specific product choices
- Reveals what founders believe strongly enough to build around
- More honest than hypothetical scenarios - they're literally building it
now
--

You can use questions 3 and 4 to discuss how accurate and complete data is
the foundation for any AI-first transformations.

What do you think?

Best,
Person B
