0|2025-11-14 00:00:00|I finally met someone who shares my niche hobbies. The matching algorithm actually feels personal and thoughtful. Truly the best dating experience yet. 
1|2025-12-05 00:00:00|This app is a total scam. Profiles are clearly bots and they just want you to pay for useless premium features. Avoid this. 
2|2025-11-22 00:00:00|It is an okay app. Not many people in my rural area, but the interface is clean and it doesn't crash often. 
3|2025-12-28 00:00:00|I love the interface! Could you add a filter for specific interests like "hiking" or "gaming" to make finding matches easier? 
4|2025-11-03 00:00:00|Incredible experience so far. I’ve gone on three great dates this week alone. The verification process makes me feel much safer. 
5|2025-12-19 00:00:00|Constant glitches. The app freezes every time I try to send a message. It is impossible to actually talk to anyone here. 
6|2025-11-08 00:00:00|Pretty standard dating app. Some good profiles, some bad ones. It works as advertised but doesn't really stand out from the others. 
7|2025-12-10 00:00:00|Met my current partner here! The prompts really help break the ice and start meaningful conversations. Highly recommend this to everyone. 
8|2025-11-15 00:00:00|The subscription price is way too high for what you get. Most "likes" I receive are from people thousands of miles away. 
9|2025-12-24 00:00:00|It would be great if we could see who liked us without paying for the full gold tier. Maybe a daily preview? 
10|2025-11-29 00:00:00|Best UI of any dating app I have used. Everything is smooth and the dark mode looks fantastic. Very happy with it. 
11|2025-12-02 00:00:00|I got banned for no reason and support won't answer my emails. I paid for a month and now I'm locked out. 
12|2025-11-12 00:00:00|It’s fine, but I wish there were more active users in my city. It feels a bit quiet lately compared to last year. 
13|2025-12-15 00:00:00|Super easy to set up. I appreciate how quickly I was able to verify my profile and start swiping. Great job! 
14|2025-11-20 00:00:00|Too many ads. Every three swipes I have to watch a video. It ruins the flow and makes it frustrating to use. 
15|2025-12-30 00:00:00|Please add a "travel mode" so I can see people in the city I am visiting next week. That would be helpful. 
16|2025-11-05 00:00:00|Finally a dating app that doesn't feel like a chore. The daily picks are actually relevant to my preferences. Great work! 
17|2025-12-11 00:00:00|The location tracking is way off. It says people are 5 miles away when they are actually in a different state. Fix this. 
18|2025-11-27 00:00:00|Just joined yesterday. Seems decent so far, though I haven't had any matches yet. Let's see how the week goes. 
19|2025-12-07 00:00:00|I really enjoy the voice note feature. It makes the profiles feel more human and real. Five stars for sure! 
20|2025-11-18 00:00:00|Total waste of time. Deleted my account after two days of getting zero responses and seeing nothing but fake accounts. 
21|2025-12-22 00:00:00|Can you guys add a way to filter by height or education level? It would save a lot of time swiping through everyone. 
22|2025-11-09 00:00:00|Found the love of my life here. We’ve been together for six months now. Thank you for making such a great platform! 
23|2025-12-14 00:00:00|Everything costs money now. You can't even see your messages without a subscription. It used to be much better than this. 
24|2025-11-25 00:00:00|It’s alright. I get a few matches here and there. Not the best but certainly not the worst one out there. 
25|2025-12-01 00:00:00|Love the "vibe" checks! Could you maybe add a feature to see if someone is looking for something long-term or casual? 
26|2025-11-30 00:00:00|Very impressed with the quality of people on here. It feels like everyone is actually looking for a real connection. 
27|2025-12-18 00:00:00|The app keeps crashing on my iPhone 13. I've reinstalled it three times and it still won't let me past the login. 
28|2025-11-06 00:00:00|Average experience. It does what it says it does. Nothing flashy, but it works fine for meeting new people in town. 
29|2025-12-27 00:00:00|This is the only app where I actually get replies. The community seems much more active and friendly than the competition. 
30|2025-11-21 00:00:00|Warning: lots of catfishes. There needs to be a better way to report suspicious accounts because the current system is slow. 
31|2025-12-09 00:00:00|I would love a feature where we can play a small mini-game together to break the ice before we start chatting. 
32|2025-11-13 00:00:00|Fantastic app! The layout is intuitive and I love that I can link my Instagram and Spotify to my profile easily. 
33|2025-12-04 00:00:00|Deleted. No matches in a month despite having a complete profile. I think the algorithm hides you unless you pay. 
34|2025-11-26 00:00:00|It’s okay. Some features are a bit confusing to navigate, but I managed to find a couple of interesting people. 
35|2025-12-20 00:00:00|Five stars! I've tried many apps and this is the only one that feels worth the time. Matches are actually high quality. 
36|2025-11-02 00:00:00|Notifications are broken. I get an alert for a message but when I open the app, there is nothing there. Very annoying. 
37|2025-12-12 00:00:00|Please let us undo a left swipe for free. Sometimes I accidentally swipe too fast and lose a potentially great match. 
38|2025-11-17 00:00:00|Best dating app on the market. The security features make me feel much more comfortable meeting strangers in person. 
39|2025-12-23 00:00:00|Horrible experience. The app is full of people just trying to sell their social media content. No real dating happening here. 
40|2025-11-07 00:00:00|Not bad. It’s a bit repetitive after a while, but I’ve had some decent conversations so I’ll keep using it. 
41|2025-12-29 00:00:00|Brilliant! I love how the app encourages you to fill out your bio. It makes for much better matches than just photos. 
42|2025-11-10 00:00:00|Every time I try to upload a photo, the app shuts down. I can't even finish my profile. Please fix this bug. 
43|2025-12-16 00:00:00|Could you add an option to filter matches by religious beliefs? It’s a very important factor for many of us users. 
44|2025-11-24 00:00:00|High quality app. The customer support team actually replied to my question within an hour. I’m very impressed with the service. 
45|2025-12-03 00:00:00|Total garbage. I paid for a week of "boost" and got absolutely zero extra views. This app is designed to steal money. 
46|2025-11-19 00:00:00|It’s a decent way to pass the time. I haven't met anyone special yet, but the people are generally nice enough. 
47|2025-12-26 00:00:00|Love it! The prompts are so funny and they really help me figure out if we have the same sense of humor. 
48|2025-11-04 00:00:00|The "unmatch" button is too close to the profile. I've accidentally unmatched two people I was actually enjoying talking to. 
49|2025-12-17 00:00:00|Suggestion: Add a "read receipt" option for messages so I know if my match has actually seen what I sent. 
50|2025-11-16 00:00:00|I’ve tried them all and this is the one I keep coming back to. It’s just more effective than the others. 
51|2025-12-08 00:00:00|Absolute trash. The app logged me out and now says my phone number is invalid. I can't get back in. 
52|2025-11-28 00:00:00|It’s an average dating app. The swipes are limited unless you pay, which is expected these days but still a bummer. 
53|2025-12-21 00:00:00|So happy! I just went on my first date through this app and it was amazing. The match was perfect. 
54|2025-11-01 00:00:00|Too many fake profiles that look like models. It’s hard to tell who is real and who is a bot anymore. 
55|2025-12-31 00:00:00|Please integrate a "video call" feature inside the app so we don't have to give out our phone numbers immediately. 
56|2025-11-11 00:00:00|I love the community feel here. People seem more respectful and less "ghosty" than on other platforms I have tried. 
57|2025-12-13 00:00:00|The app is slow and laggy. Swiping takes a second to register and it makes the whole experience feel very clunky. 
58|2025-11-23 00:00:00|It’s fine for what it is. I don’t expect much from dating apps, but this one provides a solid enough service. 
59|2025-12-25 00:00:00|Great app! I love that I can see common interests right at the top of someone's profile. Makes starting a conversation easy. 
60|2025-11-14 00:00:00|The premium price increased again. It’s becoming way too expensive for a casual user to find any success on here. 
61|2025-12-06 00:00:00|Can you add a feature to hide your profile from people you work with? Syncing LinkedIn contacts would be a lifesaver. 
62|2025-11-09 00:00:00|Best experience I’ve had in years. The matches are actually people I want to talk to. Very glad I downloaded this. 
63|2025-12-11 00:00:00|Horrendous. The app keeps telling me I have a message when I don't. It's just a bait-and-switch to get me to open it. 
64|2025-11-27 00:00:00|Just okay. It’s better than some of the older apps, but still has a lot of the same issues with ghosting. 
65|2025-12-14 00:00:00|Love the daily suggestions! I find them much more accurate than the general swipe stack. Keep up the good work! 
66|2025-11-15 00:00:00|Every profile I see is 50+ miles away even though my settings are for 10 miles. The location filter is broken. 
67|2025-12-01 00:00:00|Suggestion: Let us sort our matches by "last active" so we don't waste time messaging people who haven't logged in. 
68|2025-11-12 00:00:00|Really enjoying the app so far. The layout is clean and I haven't encountered any major bugs or issues yet. 
69|2025-12-20 00:00:00|Waste of storage. I get matches but no one ever replies. I think half the profiles are abandoned or fake. 
70|2025-11-05 00:00:00|It's a middle-of-the-road app. Nothing special but it gets the job done if you're patient enough to keep swiping. 
71|2025-12-22 00:00:00|This app changed my life. Met my fiancé here and we are getting married next month! Best app ever made. 
72|2025-11-30 00:00:00|Extremely frustrated. My profile keeps getting "under review" for no reason. I haven't even uploaded any photos yet! 
73|2025-12-04 00:00:00|It would be cool if we could add a short 5-second video clip to our profiles to show our personality. 
74|2025-11-25 00:00:00|Surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much but the quality of conversations has been much higher than on Tinder or Bumble. 
75|2025-12-07 00:00:00|I hate how many features are locked behind a paywall. You can't even filter by basic preferences without paying. 
76|2025-11-18 00:00:00|It’s fine. I use it once a day for a few minutes. Not obsessed, but it’s a nice way to meet people. 
77|2025-12-15 00:00:00|I love the "anti-ghosting" reminders. It really encourages people to keep the conversation going or end it politely. 
78|2025-11-08 00:00:00|The app crashes every time I receive a notification. It's very frustrating and makes me want to delete it. 
79|2025-12-28 00:00:00|Could you add a "friendship" mode for people who just want to find buddies and not date? That would be great. 
80|2025-11-21 00:00:00|Five stars! The verification system really works. I feel much safer knowing the person I'm meeting is real. 
81|2025-12-19 00:00:00|Terrible. There are so many scammers asking for money or trying to get you onto WhatsApp immediately. Be careful. 
82|2025-11-10 00:00:00|A bit boring. Most profiles are very similar and the prompts aren't as creative as I hoped they would be. 
83|2025-12-03 00:00:00|Great user interface! Everything is very easy to find and the app runs smoothly on my older phone. 
84|2025-11-26 00:00:00|I've been charged twice for a single month's subscription. Customer service hasn't gotten back to me in three days. 
85|2025-12-10 00:00:00|Suggestion: Include a "dating goals" tag so we can see if people want marriage, something casual, or just friends. 
86|2025-11-13 00:00:00|Best dating app experience. The algorithm seems to actually understand my "type" after a few days of swiping. 
87|2025-12-24 00:00:00|Why are there so many ads? It feels like a mobile game instead of a dating app. Very disappointing. 
88|2025-11-02 00:00:00|It's an okay app. I've had a couple of good dates but also a lot of duds. About what you'd expect. 
89|2025-12-29 00:00:00|Brilliant app! I love the daily limit on swipes. It makes me actually read the profiles instead of just mindlessly swiping. 
90|2025-11-17 00:00:00|The app is incredibly slow today. It takes forever to load photos. Please fix your servers, this is annoying. 
91|2025-12-12 00:00:00|Please add a feature to filter by lifestyle choices like "smoker" or "non-smoker". It’s a dealbreaker for me. 
92|2025-11-28 00:00:00|Truly excellent. I like the focus on personality rather than just looks. The detailed profiles are a huge plus. 
93|2025-12-05 00:00:00|Awful. The app deleted all my matches and messages for no reason. All that effort wasted in a second. 
94|2025-11-19 00:00:00|It is fairly neutral. It works, it's fine. Not the best but definitely not the worst. I’ll keep it for now. 
95|2025-12-16 00:00:00|I love the badges! They are a fun way to show off your interests. Great addition to the profile. 
96|2025-11-06 00:00:00|Too many bots. I get "liked" by the same three fake profiles every single day. The filter system is useless. 
97|2025-12-21 00:00:00|Suggestion: A "missed connections" feature based on GPS where you can see if you passed a user in real life. 
98|2025-11-22 00:00:00|Very intuitive design. I like how easy it is to navigate between my profile and the match queue. Well done. 
99|2025-12-09 00:00:00|This app is a joke. They restrict your visibility unless you pay for the most expensive plan. Total money grab. 
100|2025-11-23 00:00:00|It’s alright. The community is a bit small in my area, but the quality of people seems pretty high. 
101|2025-12-25 00:00:00|Amazing! I’ve met so many cool people here. The conversation starters are actually really helpful for shy people. 
102|2025-11-01 00:00:00|The app keeps resetting my preferences. I set it to 30 miles and it goes back to "everywhere" every time. 
103|2025-12-18 00:00:00|It would be helpful if we could see if a match has read our message. Maybe as a premium feature? 
104|2025-11-11 00:00:00|I’m having a great time. Met a few nice girls and the app hasn't crashed once. Definitely worth the download. 
105|2025-12-02 00:00:00|Broken. I can’t even see the pictures of the people I’m swiping on. It just shows a grey box. 
106|2025-11-29 00:00:00|Average dating app. It has all the usual features and the usual crowd. Nothing to complain about, nothing to praise. 
107|2025-12-27 00:00:00|I love that you can see who has a verified profile. It adds a layer of trust that other apps lack. 
108|2025-11-07 00:00:00|This app is full of people just looking for followers on Instagram. There should be a rule against linking socials. 
109|2025-12-13 00:00:00|Suggestion: Please add a "snooze" mode so I can take a break without deleting my profile and losing matches. 
110|2025-11-16 00:00:00|Simply the best. I’ve tried four other apps this month and this is the only one that feels genuine. 
111|2025-12-31 00:00:00|The app keeps crashing when I try to edit my bio. It’s been happening for a week now. Fix it! 
112|2025-11-04 00:00:00|It’s fine. The free version is quite limited, but I guess that’s how they make their money. 
113|2025-12-23 00:00:00|Best app ever. I’ve recommended it to all my single friends. The match quality is just way better here. 
114|2025-11-20 00:00:00|Not a fan. The swiping mechanic feels a bit outdated and the profiles are too short to learn anything. 
115|2025-12-08 00:00:00|Please let us sort our photos better. The current uploader is very clunky and always crops them weirdly. 
116|2025-11-24 00:00:00|Really happy with the results so far. Met someone great and we’ve been chatting for a week. Fingers crossed! 
117|2025-12-14 00:00:00|This app is a scam. They show you "likes" to get you to pay, then the likes disappear once you buy. 
118|2025-11-12 00:00:00|It’s an okay experience. It’s a bit slow but the people are real. I’d give it a three out of five. 
119|2025-12-17 00:00:00|I love the "Weekly Wrap-up" feature. It’s cool to see how many people viewed my profile and where I stand. 
120|2025-11-03 00:00:00|The app drained my battery 20% in just ten minutes of swiping. There is clearly some background process issue. 
121|2025-12-26 00:00:00|Suggestion: Add a "dealbreaker" tag for things like kids or pets so we don't waste time on incompatible matches. 
122|2025-11-27 00:00:00|Outstanding! The best part is the community guidelines that actually seem to be enforced. Very safe and fun. 
123|2025-12-11 00:00:00|The matching algorithm is terrible. It keeps showing me people who are the exact opposite of my preferences. 
124|2025-11-15 00:00:00|Not bad, not great. It’s just another dating app in a sea of dating apps. It works fine though. 
125|2025-12-06 00:00:00|I love the profile prompts. They make it so much easier to start a conversation than just saying "hey." 
126|2025-11-28 00:00:00|I can't believe how many fake accounts there are. It feels like 80% of the profiles are just AI-generated images. 
127|2025-12-22 00:00:00|Please add a dark mode! The bright white screen is blinding when I’m swiping in bed at night. 
128|2025-11-09 00:00:00|Excellent app. The distance filter is very accurate and I love that I can see who is currently online. 
129|2025-12-19 00:00:00|The app is constanty freezing. I have to force quit it every five minutes. It's almost unusable at this point. 
130|2025-11-18 00:00:00|It’s okay. A bit expensive for the premium features but the base app is functional and has enough users. 
131|2025-12-30 00:00:00|Love it! I found my current boyfriend here. The prompts are a great way to show off your personality. 
132|2025-11-05 00:00:00|Horrible customer support. They don't respond to tickets and the "help" section is just a bunch of useless FAQs. 
133|2025-12-12 00:00:00|Suggestion: Could you allow us to link our Spotify "Top Artists" so we can find people with similar music taste? 
134|2025-11-21 00:00:00|Great experience so far. The app is fast, the profiles are interesting, and I've already had a couple of matches. 
135|2025-12-04 00:00:00|Terrible. I keep getting notifications for matches that don't exist. It's just a way to get me to open the app. 
136|2025-11-13 00:00:00|It’s decent. The user base is a bit younger than I expected, but the app itself works perfectly fine. 
137|2025-12-28 00:00:00|I really like the layout and the way the profiles are presented. It feels much more modern than other apps. 
138|2025-11-02 00:00:00|The app logged me out and won't let me back in. It says my email doesn't exist. I've been a member for months! 
139|2025-12-15 00:00:00|Please add a feature where we can see if we have mutual friends. It would make everything feel much safer. 
140|2025-11-26 00:00:00|Five stars! Best dating app I have ever used. The quality of matches is significantly higher than any other platform. 
141|2025-12-01 00:00:00|Waste of money. The "boost" feature does nothing. I got more matches when I wasn't paying for anything. 
142|2025-11-08 00:00:00|It’s alright. I don’t like the new update, it made the interface much more cluttered and harder to navigate. 
143|2025-12-24 00:00:00|So glad I found this app. It’s the only one that actually works for me. Highly recommend to anyone looking for love. 
144|2025-11-17 00:00:00|The app crashes whenever I try to open a message. It's been like this since the last update. Please fix it! 
145|2025-12-09 00:00:00|Suggestion: Add a "vacation mode" so I can pause my profile while I'm away without losing my current matches. 
146|2025-11-25 00:00:00|Fantastic. I love the focus on long-form bios. It helps you get a real sense of who the person is. 
147|2025-12-10 00:00:00|Too many ads. I understand you need to make money, but it's getting ridiculous. One ad every few swipes is too much. 
148|2025-11-30 00:00:00|It’s a solid app. No major complaints. It does what a dating app should do and it does it well. 
149|2025-12-20 00:00:00|Best dating app out there. The verification process is a game changer. I feel so much safer meeting people. 
150|2025-11-14 00:00:00|Horrendous. The app keeps showing me people I’ve already swiped left on. It’s a waste of time and very annoying. 
151|2025-12-05 00:00:00|Please add a way to filter by political views. It’s a very important factor for me when choosing a partner.
